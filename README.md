# Analytics Cup 2023/2024 - Recipe Recommender Model

## Introduction
Welcome to the Analytics Cup 2023/2024 project for developing a recipe recommender model! In this project, we aim to predict whether a customer likes or dislikes a recipe based on various features such as dietary preferences, age, rating, cooking time, and macronutrient content. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of recipe suggestions provided by LLMeals, a start-up leveraging large language models for recipe generation.

## Data Understanding
We start by understanding our data and exploring relationships between variables. We utilize four datasets:
- `recipes.csv`: Contains 75,604 recipes generated by the LLM.
- `reviews.csv`: Includes 140,195 reviews where users evaluate recipe difficulty and express their liking.
- `diet.csv`: Provides information on users' dietary preferences.
- `requests.csv`: Depicts users' search filters to find new recipes.

## Data Preprocessing
- Imputed missing values and balanced the proportion of 'Like' column.
- Joined datasets using common attributes and imputed missing values based on dietary preferences.
- Transformed categorical variables and standardized numerical features.

## Model Training
We trained three different models to predict recipe likes:
1. Gradient Boosting Classifier
2. Neural Network Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier

## Model Evaluation
We evaluated each model's performance using balanced accuracy scores on the testing set.

## Deployment
Finally, we deployed the best-performing model to make predictions on the private test set, contributing to improving the overall service quality of LLMeals.
